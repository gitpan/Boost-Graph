Boost/Graph version 1.1
========================

The Boost::Graph 

INSTALLATION

To Install this module, type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Installation works as with any other CPAN distribution. This package comes bundled with the Boost Graph 
C++ Library, version 1.33. This allows the package to install without any extra installation steps. 
However, if you would like to use a different version of Boost, you can edit the following line in 
Directed/Makefile.PL and Undirected/Makefile.PL to point to your installation:
   
  'INC' => '-I. -I../include -I/usr/local/include/boost-1_33/', 

note, the Boost Library location on the example system is located in /usr/local/include/boost-1_33/
